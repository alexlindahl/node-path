# Introduction

Hi team.  Welcome to SuperMegaCorp NodeJS Boot-Up!

As you know, we've started to dig into NodeJS for more serious projects.  I've put this path together from a few useful resources I found on Outlearn.  Run through them at your own pace (it shouldn't take more than an afternoon).

We'll start with a refresher on JavaScript syntax basics for those who've been stuck in other languages for too long, and then we'll get right into the meat of NodeJS server-side framework.

Good luck!
