# Introduction

Greetings!  Welcome to JavaScript Backends with Node.js!

As many of you know, we're getting into to Node.js in a big way at SuperMegaCorp. Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, we would like to see all new application backend services implemented in Node.js starting next month, and we hope to migrate all the existing backend services to Node.js over the next 18 months.

That means everybody who touches the backend needs to acquire some respectable Node.js fu in the next 90 days. We have put together this learning path to help with process. It's relatively short and fast-paced, but an experienced programmer should have no trouble keeping up.

The learning path includes content curated from a variety of sources. We have enhanced the content to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points. You should use these exercises to verify and declare your mastery of the material. It is super satisfying to check off all the boxes.

We'll start with a pre-assessment to give you a sense of what you will need to know. Then we'll jump into an optional re-introduction to JavaScript for those who've been stuck in other languages for too long. You can skip it if you are a JS master. Then we'll get right into the meat of Node.js server-side framework with detailed tutorials and an outside project. Then you will take the same assessment you started with, but hopefully you will know more answers at that point. And at the end, you'll find links to more resources for learning advanced topics in Node.js.

Your learning coach for this path is Neo Anderson, who recently joined us from Matrix Corp, where he was a lead architect on their Node.js backend.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Neo through the social bar at the bottom of the learning path.

Good luck!
