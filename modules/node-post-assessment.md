Which of the following is generally understood to be the most compelling attribute of Node.js?
- [ ] Computational efficiency
- [X] Non-blocking I/O
- [ ] Exception handling
- [ ] Multi-threading
- [ ] None of the above

The core idea of Node.js is to use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

<!-- @multipleChoice -->

Which of the following is not one of the events that are typically associated with event-driven programming?
- [ ] User actions such as mouse/touch gestures and key presses
- [X] Algorithmic computations
- [ ] Sensor outputs
- [ ] Messages from other programs

Event programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications that are perform  actions in response to user input and interactions between systems.

Which of the following is true about fork method of the child_process module?
- [ ] The fork() method method is a special case of the spawn() to create Node processes.
- [ ] The fork method returns an object with a built-in communication channel in addition to having all the methods in a normal ChildProcess instance.
- [X] Both of the above.
- [ ] None of the above.

The fork() method method is a special case of the spawn() to create Node processes. It returns an object with a built-in communication channel in addition to having all the methods in a normal ChildProcess instance.
