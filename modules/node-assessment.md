Which of the following best described Node.js?

- [ ] A JavaScript CLI
- [ ] A new programming language
- [ ] A UI framework for JavaScript front-ends
- [X] A server-side scripting platform
- [ ] None of the above

Unlike JavaScript running in the browser, Node.js allows you to use JavaScript running on the server to create back-end services that work with a variety of front end frameworks.

Which of the following is generally understood to be the most compelling attribute of Node.js?

- [ ] Computational efficiency
- [ ] Non-blocking I/O
- [ ] Exception handling
- [ ] Multi-threading
- [ ] None of the above

The core idea of Node.js is to use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

<!-- @multipleChoice -->

Which answer best describes the kind of events that are typcially associated with event-driven programming:

- [ ] (A) User actions such as mouse/touch gestures and key presses
- [ ] (B) Sensor outputs
- [ ] (C) Messages from other programs
- [ ] (D) Algorithmic computations
- [ ] All of the above
- [ ] A and B only
- [ ] B and C only
- [X] A, B, and C, but not D
- [ ] A, C, and D, but not B
- [ ] None of the above

Event programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input and interactions between systems.

What are the two types of API functions in Node.js ?

- [ ] Asynchronous/non-blocking functions Synchronous/blocking functions
- [ ] Anonymous functions and synchronous/blocking functions
- [ ] (C) Messages from other programs
- [ ] (D) Algorithmic computations
- [ ] All of the above
- [ ] A and B only
- [ ] B and C only
- [ ] A, B, and C, but not D
- [ ] A, C, and D, but not B
- [ ] None of the above
