# Overview
Now it is time to put your newly acquired Node.js fu to work. In this project, you will create a new web application that combines a Node.js back end with a pre-written AngularJS front end.

<!-- @section-->
# Fork the Project Scaffold
The first thing you need to do is fork the project scaffold on  Github.

Here is a link to the repo that contains the working AngularJS front end and the scaffolding for your Node.js app. Click the link to go to the repo on Github, then fork the repo.

<!-- @link, "url" : "https://github.com/sigma512/node-js-sample", "text": "Fork the repo of the broken app." -->

<!-- @section-->
# Connect to the Data Store
You will first need to connect the app to a local data store. The data store is included in the project. Go through the MongoDB import process to import the data store and verify that it is working within the scaffolding by running the app locally. If everthing is working, you will get a Hello World.
